Databases are used to store and manage large amounts of structured and unstructured data, and they can be used to support a wide range of activities, including data storage, data analysis, and data management. They are used in a variety of settings, including business, scientific, and government organizations.
Examples of Database
Few examples of Database are:
Microsoft SQL Server
SQL Server, developed by Microsoft, is a Relational Database Management System. It is built on SQL, the standard query language for Database Management Systems.
Oracle Database
Developed by Oracle Corporation, Oracle Database is based on a multi-model DBMS. It is widely used when processing online transactions.
MySQL
Based on Structured Query Language (SQL), MySQL is a Relational Database Management System. It is used in e-commerce platforms, data warehousing, etc. It is widely used as a web Database Management System.

The various reasons a database is important are:
•	Manages large amounts of data
A database stores and manages a large amount of data on a daily basis. This would not be possible using any other tool such as a spreadsheet as they would simply not work.
•	Accurate
A database is pretty accurate as it has all sorts of build in constraints, checks etc. This means that the information available in a database is guaranteed to be correct in most cases.
•	Easy to update data
In a database, it is easy to update data using various Data Manipulation languages (DML) available. One of these languages is SQL.
•	Security of data
Databases have various methods to ensure security of data. There are user logins required before accessing a database and various access specifiers. These allow only authorised users to access the database.
