A file-based data management system (also called a file system) is a type of software that allows users to access and organize small groups of data. It is usually integrated into a computer’s operating system and is responsible for storing and retrieving files from a storage medium, such as a hard disk or flash drive. File systems are effectively a digitized version of paper-based filing systems for a wider range of file types. A file system, all of the files are organized into directories and folders, and sometimes the same file can be duplicated across multiple locations. This means there’s a much greater chance of data inconsistency with file systems. Plus, file systems typically have a drastically smaller capacity.
Advantages of file-based systems include:
•	Easy to use
•	Inexpensive
•	Faster performance
•	Suitable for personal data management

Disadvantages of file-based systems include:
•	Limited capacity
•	Limited functionality
•	Less security
•	Greater data inconsistency
•	No backup or recovery capabilities



The Major Challenges of File-Based Storage Systems.
1.	Data Redundancy: Data redundancy occurs when the same data is stored in multiple files or locations, resulting in inconsistencies and errors.
2.	Data Inconsistency: Data inconsistency is another major challenge in a file-based storage system. When data is stored in multiple files, it can become difficult to keep all the copies of the data in sync, resulting in inconsistencies.
3.	Limited Scalability: File-based storage systems are often not very scalable. As the amount of data in the system grows, it can become increasingly difficult to manage and maintain the system.
4.	Security: File-based storage systems are often less secure than database systems. In a file-based storage system, it can be difficult to control who has access to data and what they can do with it.
5.	Inefficient use of storage space: File-based systems can lead to inefficient use of storage space as files are duplicated or stored in multiple locations.
